# Noise_reduction_of_LIGO_data
Using simulated LIGO data this repository uses 3 very simple and quick methods to remove noise and reveal the chirps created by the simulated merger of two black holes. 
I use very simple data analysis and noise removal which is presented in the jupyter notebook. Please be aware that the plots created will be saved on your system.
